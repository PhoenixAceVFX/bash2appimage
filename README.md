# Bash2AppImage  
Another script of mine in Bash  
Ironically for the purpose of compiling Bash scripts to AppImage  
Originally used for [HyprUpld](https://github.com/PhoenixAceVFX/hyprupld) this script can compile any Bash scripts to an AppImage  
> This only works on Bash Scripts that can run without any extra ones

# How to use this?  
Clone the repo to your local system  
Create a folder named "Scripts"  
Drop your .sh files into that folder  
Put an Icon.png into the project root  
> Make sure this is a square image or you may get weird results  
> If an Icon.png isn't found it will make a placeholder

Run `bash compiler.sh`  
Profit
